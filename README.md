This config file scales the user interface of GIMP 2.10 to a best fit on Hi-DPI displays

# How to use?

Copy the **"gtkrc"** file from this repository to a custom theme on your GIMP's theme folder.

eg.

If you have GIMP installed via flatpak, then you should have a theme folder located at:

 > /home/$USER/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/config/GIMP/2.10/themes

Create a folder inside of this "theme" folder and call it whateaver you want, like "diolinux_4k" and past the **"gtkrc"** file inside it.

On GIMP, browser trought **edit>>preferences>theme** and select the theme you create, it should have the same name of the folder that you just created.

Click "OK", restart GIMP and you're done. 

That's it.
